# Calculator

A C++ calculator that can parse expressions with parentheses, operators, functions and constants. It works by converting the initial expression from [infix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation) to postfix notation (also known as [Reverse Polish notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation)), and then parsing that to get the result.
